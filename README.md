# IRS-NOMA
This repository presents a Python script for minimizing transmit power in IRS (Intelligent Reflecting Surface) NOMA (Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access) systems. By utilizing the `scipy` library, we optimize an objective function to achieve the lowest possible transmit power while maintaining reliable communication.

## Repository Contents
- **irs noma.py**: This Python script is the core of the project. By providing channel state information (CSI), you can run this script to compute and output the minimum transmit power required for IRS-NOMA systems. Make necessary adjustments to the code by editing the channel states within the script.
